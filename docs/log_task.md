- Total 409 ÷ 60 = 6 hours 49 minutes
- Important bug fixed.  
  The bug was that the component was using a single instance of the battle grid when it actually needed two instances for separate UI updates.  
  Because there was only one shared instance of the grid, only one UI was being updated, leading to incorrect rendering.  
  After adding a factory to generate two separate instances of the grid, it properly handles multiple turns and ensure both grids rendered and updated correctly.
