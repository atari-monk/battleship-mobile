# Static grid

## Description

The first few attempts at the classic Battleship game failed. This time, I want to start with a static HTML GUI component at the core of the game. The goal is for the grid to fill the entire browser screen, regardless of whether it's on a PC, laptop, or mobile device. Below the grid, there will be a space for controls. By focusing on the look and feel first, I’ll ensure the product is usable and fun. I hope the logic will follow. It's like the foundation of a building—it must work first.

## Important!

Chrome experimental dark mode destroys colors literally.  
You use color in code and then go insane why it is diffrent in browser.  
Well it is becouse experimental chrome dark mode was on.  
It was very confusing at the end of the day.
