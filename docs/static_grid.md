# Static grid

## Description

The first few attempts at the classic Battleship game failed. This time, I want to start with a static HTML GUI component at the core of the game. The goal is for the grid to fill the entire browser screen, regardless of whether it's on a PC, laptop, or mobile device. Below the grid, there will be a space for controls. By focusing on the look and feel first, I’ll ensure the product is usable and fun. I hope the logic will follow. It's like the foundation of a building—it must work first.
