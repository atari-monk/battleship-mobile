# JS

## Problem with same name function

I was going fast, it was nice for a moment.  
Then aftrer merging two js files i got warn that my component dosent have js.  
FIle was there.  
So after much confusion i decided to merge function by function.  
To my dissmay problem was found, offcourse on last of ten functions.  
Problem was that function name was duplicated, js dosent provide any warnnigs of that.  
Just crash.
So that was a nice waste of time.
