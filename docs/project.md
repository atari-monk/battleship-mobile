# Project

## Docs

The documentation should tell the story of building the project.  
It should be organized as markdown files in a docs folder,  
named after their content, with optional numbering (001, 002, etc.).  
Each feature should be documented either in its own dedicated file  
or listed on a feature list.

## Refactoring

I am now of the opinion that refactoring is optimalization after project is finished,  
or when nothing more can be done without it.

## Project structure

This time it is vanila stack.  
Simple structure to fit topic.  
Fells natural.
